Use the "sbt run" command to run your scala program and compile code using LMS.

# THIS IS THE README OF SCALA/LMS:

This description contains all the information you need to know in order to understand this project:

- main.scala is the file which is being run when you run this project. 
  Within this file, you can see the method "main", which contains serval ".run()"-calls. 
  Each call triggers an experiment of one of the three implemented algorithms. 
- Each algorithm is implemented in a different file:
    1. Binary Search:       search.scala
    2. Binary Tree Lookup:  treesearch.scala
    3. Rabin-Karp:          RabinKarp.scala
    For more information on the implementation of an algorithm, see its corresponding file.
